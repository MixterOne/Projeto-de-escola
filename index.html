                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>Traditional schools educate at the age-appropriate grade. We know that students have strengths and areas that need improvement.</p>
                    <p>We educate students at their readiness level with their interests and learning profiles in mind. We let them excel in their strengths, not holding them back to a grade level. As well, we allow them to take the time to learn those areas<br> they may need more instruction, without feeling they are falling behind or holding their peers back.<br> Success is individualized. Students will gain confidence to learn at a pace comfortable for themselves and their teachers.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>                   
                <p>Finding a specialized school in Atlanta is difficult. Our school started from a need for our own children. Our son was diagnosed with Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, and Aspergers later than most, at age 10. He had not been keeping up in school and after several years of teachers saying "he is just a boy," we decided to do something different.</p>
                <p>Our goal was to create a school in which our son could thrive and gain confidence. After four years with the same teacher, in a self-contained classroom of five students, getting one on one attention when needed, he is now fourteen and reading at a college level. We understand the struggle parents have in finding the correct fit for education</p>
                <p>We also understand that children, like our son, will generally have other needs, such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech, hippotherapy, vision therapy, which take time and money. We wanted to prioritize affordability so parents feel comfortable sending their children to school without compromising other areas of their lives.</p>
